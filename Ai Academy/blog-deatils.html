          Giving developers the tools to go further with Make
        </h1>
        <p class="blog-deatils-contin-two">Oct 25, 2024 | 4 minutes</p>
        <div class="blog-deatils-img-one">

        <div class="blog-deatils-contain">
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            At Make, we’re driven by our purpose to help you work the way you
            imagine. As part of this, we’re always thinking of ways to maximize
            the value our users can unlock using Make.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            While our
            <a href="#" 
              >visual no-code platform</a
            >
            allows those with little to no development experience to automate
            processes and integrate applications in a way that transforms the
            way they work each day, it also has huge benefits for those with
            more robust development skills.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 class="blog-deatils-contain-three">No-code benefits for developers</h2>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Where previously developers were building integrations and
            maintaining workflows for all parts of the business, with
            <a href="#">no-code</a
            >, they can now scale their efforts, deploying new solutions to the
            business at record speed.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Beyond this, no-code platforms like Make also allow developers to
            benefit from faster prototyping, reduced development cycles, and
            more efficient collaboration with business teams. This not only
            accelerates project timelines but also allows you to quickly
            experiment and iterate on ideas, empowering you to drive greater
            value within your organization and stay ahead in a rapidly evolving
            tech landscape.
          </p>
          <h2  class="blog-deatils-contain-three">Challenges of developing for a no-code platform</h2>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Having said all this, we’re fully aware that developing within the
            no-code environment can also bring its own challenges.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            As an example, developers often have concerns about using no-code
            platforms for automation due to perceived limitations in flexibility
            and customization. There can be question marks around the ability of
            no-code platforms to support complex logic or integrations needed
            for more advanced use cases.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Looking deeper, there are often challenges around collaboration in
            the testing and deployment of new integrations and systems. There
            can also be question marks around maintaining control with scale —
            and indeed whether no-code platforms have the power to scale at all.
          </p>
          <h2  class="blog-deatils-contain-three">New solutions for these challenges</h2>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            In an effort to address these — and more — challenges, we’ve
            released a range of new solutions specifically designed for
            developers using Make.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3  class="blog-deatils-contain-three">Make DevTool</h3>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Earlier this year, we unveiled key improvements to
            <a href="#"
              >Make DevTool</a
            >
            that give developers the ability to debug their Make
            scenarios.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p  class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            As part of this, an extra pane has been added to the Chrome
            Developer tools, enabling developers to review all manual scenario
            runs, performed operations and details of API calls performed. For
            improved app development, you can also view all the calls that an
            app has performed.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            This extension aims to improve the developer experience by enabling
            faster, more seamless debugging across Make scenarios, modules,
            operations, apps, and more.
          </p>
          <h3  class="blog-deatils-contain-three">Local development for apps (beta)</h3>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            In August, we also launched Local Development for Apps in beta in a
            new version of our
            <a href="#"
              >Visual Studio Code extension</a
            >, which enables developers to use Git versioning to develop custom
            apps.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            With this update, we aim to empower you to work and collaborate more
            efficiently, iterate faster, and gain full control of changes,
            history, and deployment for your app — all without disrupting the
            live applications running in production.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">Using our updated VS Studio Code extension, you can:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">

                environment.&nbsp;

          </ul>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Local Development for Apps has already been making a big impact with
            Maker users. Take
            <a href="#"

            functionality:
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            “I really like the Local Development for Apps feature in the VS Code
            extension. The most helpful aspect for me is the ability to store my
            app’s source code in GitHub. This small feature alone enables us to
            apply the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to building Make
            apps, which significantly enhances the development process. It
            facilitates version control, efficient team collaboration, and
            structured development practices, making it much easier to iterate
            on and maintain the app over time.”
          </p>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Here’s a practical example of how Volodymyr’s team puts Local
            Development for Apps to work:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
                First, Volodymyr’s colleague Alice forks the main branch of the
                app in GitHub and creates a pull request with changes for the
                new module.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
                Alice tests the new module, and once it’s ready, she asks Bob to
                review and approve the changes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
                Bob reviews the pull request and leaves comments on the code
                suggesting improvements.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
                Alice and Bob have a discussion in the pull request and decide
                that the change is necessary.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">Alice makes the change and asks Bob to check again.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
                Everything now looks good, so Bob approves the pull request.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">Once the new module is ready to be deployed:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">Alice merges the pull request into the main branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Alice then deploys the new module using the VS Code plugin
                    from Make and the Make control panel.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="blog-deatils-contain-two">
            Without the Local Development for Apps feature, even this simple
            process wouldn’t be possible and would require significantly more
            effort. And this is just one of many processes it enables. As
            Volodymyr puts it, “I believe it’s a game changer for professional
            development teams.”

            Over 44% of Make apps are built and published by people outside of
            Make - vendors, partners and users. So there’s no better place to
